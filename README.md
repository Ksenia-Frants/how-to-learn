# How-to-learn
This is my first project work. This project helped me learn how to typeset.

My project talks about modern and effective studying methods. It shares information on studying techniques from Barbara Oakley, offers a couple of educational videos on procrastination, tells about the Feynman method(how to learn and not forget the material), demonstrates facts and figures about study and the brain, shares a helpful book from Salman Khan, explains Learning Principles from Josh Kaufman and provides additional helpful resources on learning techniques and life hacks.

 __It uses technologies such as:__
 * flexbox layout;
 * advanced HTML and CSS capabilities;
 * positioning elements;
 * HTML: video, iframe, embed, API;
 * animations and transformations;
 * markup and layout of forms.

 __Plans for completion:__
 1. Choose the font I need;
 2. Add my favorite educational videos;
 3. Check the code for cross-browser compatibility and add all vendor prefixes;
 4. Design a form through which users can send me a comment.
